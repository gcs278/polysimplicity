                        Cuccinelli’s gubernatorial campaign states his desire to decrease both Virginia’s income tax rate and business income tax rate, from 5.75% to 5%, and from 6% to 4%, respectively . He said that he will offset lost tax revenue by eliminating unspecified tax loopholes. <br><br>

                        In 2007, Cuccinelli co-sponsored a bill for the Virginia Constitution that would have defined life as beginning at the moment of fertilization . That legislation would have given personhood rights to fertilized eggs . He now claims that he never supported anything that could violate people’s choice, and that government should not regulate contraception.  Virginia’s increased state health regulations that his office supported for Virginia’s first-trimester abortion facilities have caused the closure of some clinics, due to increased costs.<br><br>

                        Stated, “I don’t believe the United States should be intervening in Syria, period. After a decade of war and many Virginia families losing loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan, I am very concerned about putting more of our servicemen and women at risk for an effort that would not, in my view, address the national security interests of America.” <br><br>

He voted “Yea” to a Bill titled “Allowing Guns in Alcohol Serving Establishments,” which would allow a person to carry a concealed handgun in a public establishment if that person does not consume alcohol.  He voted “Nay” to a bill titled “Background Checks for Gun Show Purchases,” which would make it illegal to sell a firearm to someone without a concealed carry permit at a gun show.  He voted “Yea” to a bill titled “Concealed Weapons in Vehicles,” which would allow a person to carry a concealed weapon in a vehicle if it is locked in a compartment.<br><br>

Cuccinelli says his views are “evolving .” He stated that he is not personally ready to legalize marijuana.<br><br>

                        Voted “Yea” in the Virginia Senate on a bill titled Defining Marriage (SB 526), which was defined as being between a man and a woman.  He warned that gay marriage threatened familial values because it would lead to polygamy.  In 2010 Cuccinelli sent letters to state universities advising them to drop their discrimination protections for gay workers.<br><br>

                        In Cuccinelli’s own newsletter, the Cuccinelli Compass, he endorsed the State Legislature for Legal Immigration which is a group that is dedicated to cutting off economic, education, and employment opportunities to undocumented immigrants.” Cuccinelli endorsed a senate resolution urging congress to take action to end “birthright citizenship.”  In 2007, he made clear his approval of a county law that required police to check the immigration status of anyone who was arrested.  In 2010, he issued a legal opinion that allowed Virginia law enforcement to check the legal status of a person they had stopped.  Cuccinelli voted “Nay” on two separate occasions for two Bills titled In-State Tuition for Undocumented Immigrants . These bills would have allowed undocumented immigrants who had attended high school in Virginia or received a GED, had been accepted to a public university, had lived in the state for at least three years, and whose parents had paid income tax for the last three years, and were actively trying to become permanent citizens the right to receive in-state tuition at public universities.<br><br>

                        His 12-point plan for education includes a “push for charter schools, offer voucher-like scholarships for preschoolers and empower a majority of parents to take over their children’s failing school.” He seeks to add an amendment to Virginia’s constitution that would allow government funds to flow to religious schools.  He stated that his administration would support SJ 302 which was a proposal to amend the Virginia Constitution to allow the state board of education authority to establish charter school divisions of Virginia.<br><br>

Voted “Nay” to a bill that would have allowed second degree accomplices in capital murder cases to be charged with capital murder under specific circumstances. Stated that, “I think that capital punishment is constitutional and an appropriate part of a criminal justice system. However I am very cautious in my support of the death penalty, and I have frequently resisted significant expansions of the death penalty.”<br><br>
