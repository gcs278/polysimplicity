                        Would like to reduce taxes on businesses.  He wants to create a Tax Reform Plan that would reduce or eliminate anti-growth taxes that involve taxes on small businesses, taxes on the cost of machinery for manufacturers, and taxes on businesses for daily inventory .

Under the Affordable Care Act the federal government will fully cover any state willing to expand Medicaid coverage , although in several years the federal government will drop to only covering 90% of the additional costs. <br><br>
